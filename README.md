# Gaming-Habits-Psychological-Wellbeing
This project explores gaming habits and their impact on psychological well-being using data from over 13,000 gamers across 109 countries. Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting predict anxiety levels while uncovering correlations between gaming behavior, socio-economic factors, and mental health.
